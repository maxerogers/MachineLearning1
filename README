For Windows:
	I have built a Ruby executable .exe file ‘hw1.exe’. You can use double click it like any other ‘.exe’ file. It should run properly

For Mac:
	Modern Mac should have Ruby 1.8.7 installed. You will go into your terminal navigate to the directory you have extracted the zip file and run the command “ ruby hw1.rb “

If you don’t have Ruby installed or for some reason the windows exe won’t run, a simple solution is to download RailsInstaller as it is a bundled package for  Mac and Windows operating systems.

If you are using Ubuntu here is a link to install Ruby without Ruby Version Manager

I choose to use Ruby because unlike technologies like Mat Lab, I know how to reuse it for other projects in Ruby and Java

Terminal Command:
	"ruby hw1.rb"
